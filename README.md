## Main Character –
### Lucy – 
A gray and black tabby who attended the magical cat academy, Magic Cat-Cademy. During her studies, she learned many types of magic and has continued practicing following her years of studying. She is a fearless, determined, and ambitious cat. She would do anything to protect her companions. 

Her main type of magic is working with a wand, casting spells of different kinds. She can shoot fireballs, magic beams, and light from her wand. As time moves, her magic abilities will grow, and she will gain more stamina to be quicker and more efficient. 

The game is played in the third person; you will control Lucy without directly seeing her perspective. You will be watching from the side view and will control her movements and attacks against the opponents.

## Opponents –
There is one main species of opponents, hellhounds, but the main leaders must be defeated, along with their hellhound minions. 

### Cerberus – 
A known Greek legend, a three-headed hellhound, but in this story he only has one head. He is the leader of all of the hellhounds and the mastermind behind the attack against Felandia. He is described as a large dog with glowing red eyes, and a fire tipped tail.

His powers include summoning fire, summoning and controlling hellhound minions, and breathing fire. He is the strongest of the hellhounds and the game's last boss. You must defeat him to complete the game and save the land of Felandia from further destruction.

### Juno – 
The second strongest hellhound, she is described as a large black hellhound with red eyes and large horns on her head. She is Cerberus' second-in-command and takes orders from him. 

Her powers are similar to Cerberus’s, although much weaker. She can summon and breathe fire. Her horns can also be used as a weapon, as they are extremely sharp. 

### Mars – 
The lowest hellhound among the three, he is described as a large red hellhound with black eyes. He is ranked under Cerberus and Juno and must follow both of their orders. 

His powers are the same as Juno’s, although he does not have horns. He can only summon and breathe fire. His powers have not evolved as much as Juno’s and are weaker. 

### Hellhound Minions – 
The minions of Cerberus are tasked with causing as much destruction as possible to Felandia. They can only breathe fire and must listen to what Cerberus says. They are much weaker compared to Cerberus, Juno, and Mars. 

These are the main enemies on each level, and you will only encounter the other three hellhounds at the end of each level.

## Side Characters – 
### Sierra – 
A skittish brown tabby cat, who attended the academy with Lucy. She rules over the cozy meadows. During her studies, she met Lucy because she was her mentor, as Sierra is a few years older than her. 

Her powers focus mostly on upping her physical power. Such as making herself move quicker, for longer periods of time and also upping her physical strength and making herself stronger.

### Nova – 
A short-haired white cat with a bobtail. She rules over the tropical rainforest. She attended the academy before Lucy but was often seen as a professor's assistant around the academy. She assisted many of Lucy and Sierra’s classes and was always there if anyone needed help. 

Her powers are similar to Lucy’s as she also uses a magical wand to attack. She can spawn different types of light and darkness from the wand. She was one of the most powerful cats in her classes. 

### Karma – 
A brown maine-coon cat with long fur. She is the eldest of the leaders. She rules over the scorching desert. She was a professor at the academy and taught some of the best cats in Felandia, including our main character, Lucy. 

Her powers focus on spawning water. Although she is a cat, she does enjoy water. She is one of the strongest water magicians in Felandia, and taught water magic at the academy.

## Environment –
As mentioned previously, Felandia has multiple biomes that have been taken over, such as the cozy meadows, scorching savannah, and tropical rainforest. 
		
### Cozy Meadows – 
A very relaxing area with fields of flowers and grass. Since being taken over by hellhounds, it hasn’t been quite as cozy, covered in fire and magma. There are hills everywhere, with oak trees sprinkled in every so often. 

### Scorching Savannah – 
A savannah with some areas desert-like and some more foresty. Some areas are closer to being a desert, but some areas have savannah trees everywhere. It gets very hot in the savannah, as the sun shines brighter and stronger in the savannah. 

### Tropical Rainforest –
A rainforest with many tall trees. It is littered with forestry foliage, bushes and more, the perfect biome to get lost in. You must traverse the difficult terrain to escape. There are many rivers, lakes, and ponds throughout the forest.

## Menus –
Upon loading, you will have the name of the game across the top in a fantasy-style font. Underneath, you will see the option to play, select a level, and then options. I will have a solid colour filling the background. The colours and fonts, such as purples, browns, blues, and more, will represent the magic aspect of the game.

## Controls –
### Movement – 
It is a side-scroller game, so you can only move left or right. You can either use ‘A’ or the left arrow key to move left. You can use the ‘D’ key or the right arrow key to move right. The last movement you will need to do is jump, which will be done with the spacebar.

### Attacking – 
To attack, you will click the left button on the mouse. It will have a cooldown to fire, so you wont be able to spam click the mouse to continuously fire.

## Sounds –
### Music –
The music will be an adventurous soundtrack. The music will be very enchanting as to represent the magic element of the game. It will help you to feel more immersed into the game, and help you really feel like you are apart of this magical world. 

### Magic –
It will have a different sound for each when using a magic ability. For Lucy/Nova, they fire using a wand, so there will be a magic shooting sound to fire. For Karma, she uses water magic, so there will be a water sound when she summons water. Sierra uses physical magic, so a power-up sound would play similar to one you would hear in Mario after receiving a mushroom. Lastly, the hellhound's magic will have a fireball sound upon spawning/breathing fire.

### Movement –
There will be sounds relating to what the player is moving on when moving. So, if you are on grass, it will have a crunchy walking sound; if in water, it will have sloshing sounds; if on the sand, it will have walking-on-sand sounds.
### Entities –
Cats – 
As a little easter-egg, I will implement a meow button for the player to use. A key on the keyboard will be designated to make your player meow. 

Hellhounds –
They will be able to bark and growl. It will be played upon attack.
